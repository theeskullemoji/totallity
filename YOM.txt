The pictures refer to the song The Warning (by Logic) which you can see by rearranging the images: war + ning and LO + (crypto) gic. This webpage contains a hidden POST form which can be accessed in the browser debug mode (F12 in chrome). You need to unhide it, enter the password theflowerblossomsthroughwhatseemstobeaconcretesurface and hit Submit button. You'll be redirected to the next step.

The pictures also refer to a program called "Vanitygen++" by 10GIC.

phase2.png

This is a reference to The Matrix Reloaded movie:

Merovingian: You see, there is only one constant one universal: causality - cause and effect.

Morpheus: Everything begins with choice.

Merovingian: No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without.

The password is causality.

SHA256(causality) = eb3efb5151e6255994711fe8f2264427ceeebf88109e1d7fad5b0a8b6d07e5bf

To decypher the text, use openssl. Copy the encrypted text into phase2.txt, then run:

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -a -in phase2.txt -pass pass:eb3efb5151e6255994711fe8f2264427ceeebf88109e1d7fad5b0a8b6d07e5bf
Decryption result:

The ironic 2name of the keymakers trying to protect the current digital powers which are still in severe danger due to the keymaker's way of security by hiding, nearly unprotected, in plain sight. {eps3.4_[in one of the valleys of Phillip]runtime-error.r00., where daughters hit magic keypads} When this fails.. Crypto finally to the latin 3Moon? Tell me, 4How so mate?
# X 2 S H 4 Y 0 Q B 15 #
Q -> extend the name of a hackers' swordless fish, the I and W are below. (*Shakespeare)
B -> ((BV80605001911AP)- (sqrt(-1)))^2  (*Jean Lucs Pons kangaroo?)
H -> (Answer to only this puzzle but nothing else) * -1  (either "Hashing" or "Halving"
S -> cha' + (vagh * jav)
Ok kid, on the highway, let put it in the worst gear. (*The worst gear, Derive?)
It is unclear how to use X 2 S H 4 Y 0 Q B 15, but it was observed that S is Klingon numbers 2+(5*6)=32 and BV80605001911AP is a model of Intel i5 processor, hence B=(5i-i)^2=(4i)^2=-16. Using the other hints (2name, 3Moon, 4How so mate) which are a reference to a Thales Hardware Security Module, you can decrypt the next phase. The password is a concatenation of 7 parts. The first part is causality. (* 2name 3moon 4How so mate?) is in refernce to the eternity wall and the messages that are on it which relate to these phrases)

For part 5, you have to follow the ramblings, (these are a bit of a stretch)

There's a guy who theorised the idea that 'Any linear electrical network with voltage and current sources and only resistances can be replaced at terminals A–B by an equivalent current source Ino in parallel connection with an equivalent resistance Rno'.

Norton's theorem
ruler of a piece of land that's technically the poorest of the entire planet

Probably the USA due to foriegn debt
4 rulers have shared the first name of the competition.

USA had four presidents with the first name "John"
2 had the firstname in the surname

USA had 2 presidents with the last name "Johnson"
One of the rulers had a number, and dirty too

JFK (John Fitzgerald Kennedy)
The one after died too soon.

JFK? "A president may have executed a specific order.")
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_executive_orders#John_F._Kennedy_(1961%E2%80%931963)
Moral: never execute an order that revokes the highest power or you might suddenly get killed. The 5binary code is a part of the piece of this puzzle.

There are two executive orders by JFK that look like 5 digit binary "11110" and 11111", however, EO 1110 was to "[try] to rein in the power of the Federal Reserve" and may have been a reason for his assassination.

Part 6:

Its' raw data after 4 on row 1616 to be one of the last pieces of this part required in order to continue this riddle. Is a reference to the genesis block, and the source code to bitcoin itself

// line 1616 of main.cpp
// txNew.vin[0].scriptSig     = 486604799 4 0x736B6E616220726F662074756F6C69616220646E6F63657320666F206B6E697262206E6F20726F6C6C65636E61684320393030322F6E614A2F33302073656D695420656854
At this point you see "/(aBa, connected enf)" which is the puzzle's way of saying: don't change the casing of the input (aBa) and remove whitespace (connected enf)

Part 7:

B5KR/1r5B/6R1/2b1p1p1/2P1k1P1/1p2P2p/1P2P2P/3N1N2 w - - 0 1

And now a buddhist is forced to move. What will be the next situation?

This part displays chess board position and is asking the position of the board after making a move that will not result in mate (a buddhist move). It's a fairly well known problem in chess and searching for the chess position quoted will give you:

B5KR/1r5B/2R5/2b1p1p1/2P1k1P1/1p2P2p/1P2P2P/3N1N2 b - - 0 1

and here you'll see "/(aBa, connected not enf)" meaning: don't change the casing of input (aBa) but keep the whitespace (connected not enf)

"... am I here? Wake up, you..." is your first clue, it's a direct quote from the first matrix movie "Why am I here? Wake up, Neo. The matrix has you" (often in the gsmg puzzle, "neo" is replaced with "you"

The next clue is "I've designed you a beautiful strategic position" hinting at a "beautiful" -> "beaufort" cipher, where as "One for one, four for one" hints at the encoding. one for one, four for one -> 1 for 1, 4 for 1 -> 1141 -> IBM EBCDIC 1141 encoding

The alphabet is hinted at in the following sentence: A fubcd-king & oracle-queen, thingky mvps, on a sad board but as wide as the first one seen. (*Ok I've come across  cheat sheet of sorts that  wont disclose where at the moment but its a reliable souce,supposedly the key to this part is "BULLSHIT" im some sort of way. I have no idea)

fubcd-king & oracle-queen, thingky mvps
FUBCD ORACLE THINGKY MVPS
(removing repeated characaters): FUBCD ORA.LE THINGKY MVPS

output: IN CASE YOU MANAGE TO CRACK THIS THE PRIVATE KEYS BELONG TO HALF AND BETTER HALF AND THEY ALSO NEED FUNDS TO LIVE (*The answer to this portion is Neighbors, half and double" but i dont understand exactly how to make it fit, i was thinking something along the lines of Shake128 and Shake256? half and double? and the whole time hes speaking like Shakespeare, and also, it meants  hackers swordless fish, Shakespeare, shake hashing function. I dont know thats my take on it)

There's a hint from the creator of the puzzle on Decentraland: decentraland image If you go to Decentraland and find these coordinates, you'll get an audio file. Split stereo track, invert one of them, mix them back, mix stereo down to mono, create a spectrogram. The answer is: HASHTHETEXT

Roses are White but often Red.
Yellow has a number and so does Blue.
Go back to the first puzzle piece without further ado.

It might have shown you only one door, beware that the rabbits nest may contain a whole lot more.

Hush hush.
Go to the first puzzle piece (https://gsmg.io/puzzle) and hash the text there.

SHA256(GSMGIO5BTCPUZZLECHALLENGE1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe) = 89727c598b9cd1cf8873f27cb7057f050645ddb6a7a157a110239ac0152f6a32
The resulting hash leads to the SalPhaseIon and Cosmic Duality phase https://gsmg.io/89727c598b9cd1cf8873f27cb7057f050645ddb6a7a157a110239ac0152f6a32

This phase can be split into multiple sections, only some are currently decoded

The two "abba" sections can be decoded first, where we translate a=0, b=1, and interpret the resulting string as binary representation of ascii characters:

a b b a b b a b a b b a a a a b a b b b a b a a a b b b a a b a a b b a b a a b a b b b b a a a a b b b a a b b a b b b a b a b a b b a b b a b a b b a b b a a a b b a b a a b a b b b a a b b a b b b a b a a -> "matrixsumlist"

a b b a a b a b a b b a b b b a a b b b a b a a a b b a a b a b a b b b a a b a -> "enter"

Next, we see two occurances of "shabef", and the English text "our first hint is your last command". To get into Salphaseion, we had to sha256() a string, which gives us the mapping shabef=sha256 -> b=2,e=5, f=6, or, a=1 .. z = 26. But, the rest of the text doesn't seem to decode the same way. We notice that "z" seems to be a separator for various segments, and comes before other substrings, we have:

a g d a f a o a h e i e c g g c h g i c b b h c g b e h c f c o a b i c f d h h c d b b c a g b d a i o b b g b e a d e d d e
c f o b f d h g d o b d g o o i i g d o c d a o o f i d h
Again, using a1z26 doesn't seem to get us anywhere, but if we look at which characters are available it will give us a clue. "a" through "i" and "o", 10 characters, and we know that a=1, and i=9, we can guess that "o" is "0", this updates our decode to:

174161018595377387932283725836301293648834223172419022725145445
36026487402470099740341006948
Through some trial and error, we find that these need to be shifted to base 16, then decoded as hex representation of ascii
